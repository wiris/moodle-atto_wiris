Feature: Edit MathType styled formula
  In order to check if styled MathType formula can be edited correctly
  As an admin
  I need to create a styled MathType formula

  Background:
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | config  | value        | plugin      |
      | toolbar | math = wiris | editor_atto |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | topics |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user  | course | role           |
      | admin | C1     | editingteacher |
    And the "wiris" filter is "on"
    And the "mathjaxloader" filter is "off"
    And the "urltolink" filter is "off"
    And I log in as "admin"
