Maths and chemistry toolbars are available from different icons in Atto toolbar.

**Note**: MathType can be used for free up to a certain level of uses per natural year. Read [license conditions and prices](https://www.wiris.com/en/pricing/) on our website.

## Contributing

The Javascript source code of this Atto editor's button is located at `yui/src/button/button.js`.

If you plan to make changes on this code you will need to rebuild the Javascript files used by Moodle, in order to be executed.

Then, you will be able to use `grunt` to rebuild this plugin's source code to a set of Javascript files on the `yui/build/moodle-atto_wiris-button` folder.

```sh
# Run this command on the 'yui' folder of this project.
$ grunt
```
